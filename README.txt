1) TO run the experiments, just follow the notebook and do all the sections
"set-up"
"SAM LOGIC"
"Train models"
then choose which dataset and model to test.
2) The code developed by myself was the setup, the general functions all besisdes the "CIFAR" class( which I used as inspiration to simplify my dataset imports from 
https://github.com/davda54/sam/tree/main
Also from this link I got the momentum and loss function, which I found to be the ones also used in the paper and already implemented for me.
Then I created the test/train functions and running functions plus graphs.
To graph , loss/accuracy, change the argument for it
3)The DATASETS used were CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, but imported from pytorch.
